## What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt represents the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. It's important to track and manage technical debt to maintain code quality and prevent it from becoming unmanageable.

## How to Use This Log

### Adding New Debt
1. Create a new entry in the "Technical Debt Items" section
2. Use the template below
3. Assign a priority (High/Medium/Low)
4. Add relevant labels

## Technical Debt Items

### [TD-001] Image Optimization - Lazy Loading Implementation

**Created**: 2025-08-01  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: M  
**Labels**: performance, images, optimization  
**Related Issues**: #45  

#### Description
Images are not currently lazy loaded, which affects initial page load performance, especially on pages with many images like the gallery.

#### Impact
- Slower page load times
- Higher bandwidth usage
- Poorer user experience on slower connections

#### Proposed Solution
Implement native lazy loading with `loading="lazy"` and consider a JavaScript-based solution for better browser compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add `loading="lazy"` to all non-critical images
- [ ] Implement Intersection Observer for browsers that don't support native lazy loading
- [ ] Test performance impact
- [ ] Document implementation

### [TD-002] CSS Refactor - Reduce Specificity

**Created**: 2025-07-15  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: L  
**Labels**: css, refactoring, maintainability  
**Related Issues**: #32  

#### Description
CSS has high specificity in many places, making it difficult to maintain and override styles when needed.

#### Impact
- Difficult to maintain
- Larger CSS bundle size
- Harder to debug styling issues

#### Proposed Solution
Refactor CSS to follow a consistent naming convention (BEM) and reduce specificity.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit CSS for high specificity selectors
- [ ] Refactor to use BEM methodology
- [ ] Document CSS architecture
- [ ] Update style guide

### [TD-003] Dependency Updates - Outdated Packages

**Created**: 2025-08-05  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: S  
**Labels**: dependencies, security  
**Related Issues**: #51  

#### Description
Several dependencies have updates available, including security patches.

#### Impact
- Potential security vulnerabilities
- Missing out on performance improvements
- Possible compatibility issues

#### Proposed Solution
Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions and test thoroughly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update all dependencies
- [ ] Test for breaking changes
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Deploy to staging for testing

## Resolved Items

### [TD-R001] Form Validation - Client-Side Implementation

**Created**: 2025-06-10  
**Resolved**: 2025-07-22  
**Related PR**: #89  

#### Description
Added client-side form validation to improve user experience and reduce server load.

#### Solution Implemented
- Implemented HTML5 form validation
- Added custom validation messages
- Improved error styling
