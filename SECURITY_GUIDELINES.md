## Security Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary access
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Fail Securely**: Handle failures without exposing sensitive information
4. **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
5. **Privacy by Design**: Protect user privacy throughout development

### Threat Model
- **Attack Surface**: Public-facing website, APIs, admin interfaces
- **Potential Threats**: XSS, CSRF, SQLi, DDoS, data breaches
- **Assets at Risk**: PII, student records, payment information

## Authentication & Authorization

### Password Policies
- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Require mix of character types
- Enforce password rotation every 90 days
- Prevent password reuse (last 5 passwords)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Required for all admin accounts
- Recommended for all users
- Support for TOTP and security keys
- Backup codes required

### Session Management
- Secure, HTTP-only cookies
- Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
- Regenerate session ID after login
- Invalidate sessions on logout

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 required
- **At Rest**: AES-256 for sensitive data
- **Key Management**: Use AWS KMS or equivalent

### Data Classification
| Level | Examples | Protection Required |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Public | Website content | Basic |
| Internal | Staff directories | Access controls |
| Confidential | Student records | Encryption, strict access |
| Restricted | Payment info | Maximum protection |

### Data Retention
- Follow FERPA and state regulations
- Regular data purging schedule
- Secure deletion methods

## Secure Development

### Secure Coding Practices
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Output encoding to prevent XSS
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQLi
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Regular dependency updates

### Code Review
- Required for all changes
- Security-focused checklist
- Automated static analysis
- Manual security review for high-risk changes

### Dependency Management
- Regular vulnerability scans
- Pin dependency versions
- Use Dependabot for updates
- Monitor security advisories

## API Security

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- JWT with appropriate expiration
- Rate limiting
- Scope-based access control

### Request Validation
- Strong input validation
- Request size limits
- Content type validation
- Request signing where appropriate

### Response Security
- No sensitive data in URLs
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Error handling without stack traces
- CORS policy enforcement

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS protection
- Network segmentation
- VPN for administrative access

### Server Hardening
- OS and software updates
- Disable unnecessary services
- File integrity monitoring
- Logging and monitoring

### Cloud Security
- IAM least privilege
- Security groups and NACLs
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security assessments

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Monitoring
- SIEM for log aggregation
- Real-time alerting
- Anomaly detection
- Regular log reviews

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Preparation**: Tools and training
2. **Identification**: Detect and confirm
3. **Containment**: Limit impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore services
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve processes

### Breach Notification
- Legal requirements
- Internal reporting
- Customer notification
- Regulatory reporting

## Compliance

### Regulations
- FERPA (student records)
- COPPA (children's privacy)
- State education laws
- PCI DSS (if processing payments)

### Audits
- Annual security assessment
- Penetration testing
- Compliance certification
- Third-party audits

### Documentation
- Security policies
- Risk assessments
- Compliance reports
- Audit logs

## Security Training

### Developer Training
- Secure coding practices

## Best Practices

### Web Application Security Headers
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### Secure Configuration
- Disable directory listing
- Disable server version info
- Disable HTTP methods (TRACE, OPTIONS)
- Set secure cookie flags
- Disable caching of sensitive data

### Regular Security Tasks
