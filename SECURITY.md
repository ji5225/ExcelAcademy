## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you find.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing our security team at [security@excelacademy.edu](mailto:security@excelacademy.edu). We will respond to your report within 48 hours.

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. The potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Any suggested remediation or mitigation steps
5. Your name and affiliation (if any)
6. Your contact information

### Our Security Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. We will investigate the issue and confirm its validity
3. We will work on a fix in a private repository
4. Once the fix is ready, we will release a security update
5. We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Safe Harbor

We follow the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure). If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized, we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and we will not initiate or recommend legal action related to your research.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patches for the latest version of the software. We recommend always running the latest stable version.
